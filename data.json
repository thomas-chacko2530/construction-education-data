  <h2 style='margin-top: 1em;'>üìå Importance of Foundations in Construction</h2>\
  <p>A foundation is the lowest part of a building that transfers the load safely to the ground. It plays a vital role in providing strength, stability, and long-term safety to any structure.</p>\
  <ul>\
    <li><strong>Load Distribution</strong> ‚Äì Spreads the weight of the structure evenly.</li>\
    <li><strong>Stability</strong> ‚Äì Keeps the structure anchored against external forces.</li>\
    <li><strong>Prevents Settlement</strong> ‚Äì Reduces risk of cracks and tilting.</li>\
    <li><strong>Moisture Protection</strong> ‚Äì Shields from groundwater damage.</li>\
    <li><strong>Durability</strong> ‚Äì Extends the lifespan of the structure.</li>\
  </ul>\
  <h2 style='margin-top: 1em;'>üèóÔ∏è Types of Foundations</h2>\
  <p>Foundations are mainly categorized into two types based on depth and soil conditions:</p>\
  <ol>\
    <li><strong>Shallow Foundations</strong></li>\
    <li><strong>Deep Foundations</strong></li>\
  </ol>\
  <h3 style='margin-top: 1em;'>üß± Shallow Foundations</h3>\
  <p>Used when the surface soil is strong and the building load is moderate. These are economical and easy to build.</p>\
  <ul>\
    <li><strong>Isolated Footing</strong> ‚Äì For individual columns. Common in houses.</li>\
    <li><strong>Combined Footing</strong> ‚Äì Supports two or more columns.</li>\
    <li><strong>Strip Footing</strong> ‚Äì Continuous footing for walls.</li>\
    <li><strong>Raft Foundation</strong> ‚Äì Thick slab covering the whole area. Used in poor soil.</li>\
  </ul>\
  <h3 style='margin-top: 1em;'>üï≥Ô∏è Deep Foundations</h3>\
  <p>Used when topsoil is weak and loads need to be transferred to deeper, stronger layers.</p>\
  <ul>\
    <li><strong>Pile Foundation</strong> ‚Äì Long columns driven deep into soil. Ideal for high-rises and bridges.</li>\
    <li><strong>Pier Foundation</strong> ‚Äì Deep cylindrical supports cast in place.</li>\
    <li><strong>Caisson Foundation</strong> ‚Äì Watertight, used in underwater works or bridges.</li>\
  </ul>\
  <h2 style='margin-top: 1em;'>üìä Quick Comparison Table</h2>\

        <td>Deep (e.g., Pile)</td>\
        <td>&gt; 3 meters</td>\
        <td>High</td>\
        <td>High-rise buildings, poor soil</td>\
      </tr>\

  <h2 style='margin-top: 1em;'>üß† How to Choose the Right Foundation</h2>\
  <ul>\
    <li>Type and load of the structure</li>\
    <li>Soil bearing capacity</li>\
    <li>Groundwater level</li>\
    <li>Nearby structures or slope conditions</li>\
